# InstallChocolatey

This is a simple `.exe` installer for Chocolatey.

Installing Chocolatey is [not very user-friendly](https://chocolatey.org/install) because it
involves running PowerShell commands with administrative privileges, something most end-users
are not familiar with.

This simple installer takes care of everyting, with the possibility of installing Chocolatey
GUI, as well as specifying an additional package source for some enterprise scenarios.
